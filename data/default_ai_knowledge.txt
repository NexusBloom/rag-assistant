# Computer Science Fundamentals

## Data Structures

### Arrays
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value.

### Linked Lists
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements are linked using pointers. Each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the sequence.

### Trees
A tree is a hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes. Nodes represent values and are connected by edges. The topmost node is called the root. Binary trees are the most common type where each node has at most two children.

### Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted. They are used to represent networks, social connections, and pathfinding problems.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Quick Sort**: Divide and conquer algorithm with average O(n log n) complexity
- **Merge Sort**: Stable divide and conquer algorithm with guaranteed O(n log n) complexity
- **Bubble Sort**: Simple comparison-based algorithm with O(n²) complexity

### Search Algorithms
- **Binary Search**: Efficient search algorithm for sorted arrays with O(log n) complexity
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores neighbors level by level, uses queue
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch, uses stack

### Dynamic Programming
A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It stores the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computation. Examples include Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, and shortest path algorithms.

## Operating Systems

### Process Management
A process is an instance of a program in execution. The operating system manages process creation, scheduling, and termination. Key concepts include:
- Process states: new, ready, running, waiting, terminated
- Context switching: saving and restoring process state
- Inter-process communication (IPC)

### Memory Management
Techniques used to manage computer memory:
- **Paging**: Dividing memory into fixed-size blocks called pages
- **Segmentation**: Dividing memory into variable-size segments
- **Virtual Memory**: Using disk space as an extension of RAM

## Database Systems

### SQL
Structured Query Language for managing relational databases:
- SELECT: Retrieve data
- INSERT: Add new records
- UPDATE: Modify existing records
- DELETE: Remove records
- JOIN: Combine tables

### Normalization
Process of organizing data to reduce redundancy:
- **1NF**: Atomic values, no repeating groups
- **2NF**: 1NF + no partial dependencies
- **3NF**: 2NF + no transitive dependencies

## Computer Networks

### OSI Model
7-layer model for network architecture:
1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer

### TCP/IP
Core protocols of the Internet:
- **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol, reliable connection-oriented communication
- **IP**: Internet Protocol, addressing and routing packets
- **HTTP**: HyperText Transfer Protocol, web communication

## Software Engineering

### Agile Methodology
Iterative approach to software development:
- Scrum: Framework with sprints, daily standups, retrospectives
- Kanban: Visual workflow management
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

### Design Patterns
Reusable solutions to common problems:
- **Singleton**: Single instance of a class
- **Factory**: Creating objects without specifying exact class
- **Observer**: One-to-many dependency between objects
- **MVC**: Model-View-Controller architecture

## Programming Paradigms

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes from existing ones
- **Polymorphism**: Same interface, different implementations
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details

### Functional Programming
- Immutable data
- First-class functions
- Pure functions (no side effects)
- Recursion over loops
